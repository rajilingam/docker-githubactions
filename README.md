What is GitHub Actions?
GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows developers to automate various tasks related to their software development workflows directly within the GitHub environment. With GitHub Actions, developers can define custom workflows using YAML syntax to specify the steps and conditions for executing tasks such as building, testing, deploying, and releasing software.

What are Workflows?
Workflows are a set of automated steps that are triggered based on certain events in your GitHub repository. These events can include pushing code to the repository, creating pull requests, or releasing a new version. Workflows are defined using YAML syntax and are stored in a .github/workflows directory in your repository.

Run the Workflow locally:
While GitHub Actions is great for automating your workflow, running your actions locally on your machine can be helpful. Running actions locally allows you to test your workflows in a more controlled environment and ensure theyâ€™re working as expected before pushing changes to your repository. GitHub Actions is a powerful tool that allows you to automate your software development workflows in a very efficient way.
